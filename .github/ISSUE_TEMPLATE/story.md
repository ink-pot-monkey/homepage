## User Story: Tell Us What and Why!

This is the heart of your feature. Fill in the blanks:

**As a** `[who is the user? e.g., new visitor, registered student, admin]`
**I want to** `[what action do they want to perform? e.g., see all available courses, submit my project]`
**So that** `[what is the benefit or value for them? e.g., I can choose a course that fits my needs, I can get feedback on my work]`

### üìù More Details (The "Story" Behind the Story)

*   **What problem does this solve for the user?**
    *(e.g., "Currently, users can't easily find courses by topic, making it hard to decide.")*
*   **Is there anything else important to know?**
    *(e.g., "This should be the first thing a new visitor sees." or "We need to consider users on mobile devices.")*

---

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria (How will we know it's done and working?)

Think like a user: "If I do X, then Y should happen." These help us test the feature.
Keep them small and specific!

*   **Given** `[some context or starting state]`
    **When** `[I take an action]`
    **Then** `[this outcome should occur]`
    *(Example: Given I am not logged in, When I visit the homepage, Then I see a "Sign Up" button.)*

*   **Scenario:** `[Describe a simple test case]`
    **Expected Result:** `[What should happen?]`
    *(Example: Scenario: User clicks the "View Details" button for a course. Expected Result: The page navigates to the course details page for that specific course.)*

*   _[Add more criteria as needed. Just make sure each one is testable!]_

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Brainstorm (How might we build this?)

*(Optional, but helpful for planning! You don't need to create separate task issues *yet*, just jot down initial thoughts. You can create formal "‚öôÔ∏è Technical Task" issues later and link them back here.)*

*   What main pieces of work are involved?
    *   *(e.g., Design the new course listing page UI)*
    *   *(e.g., Create an API endpoint to fetch all courses)*
    *   *(e.g., Write frontend code to display courses)*
    *   *(e.g., Add a new table to the database for X)*
*   Are there any tricky parts or things we need to research?

### üö´ Out of Scope (What this story is *NOT* about)

*(Optional, but can be super helpful to keep things focused!)*

*   *(e.g., This story does not include user reviews for courses.)*
*   *(e.g., Advanced search filtering will be a separate story.)*

**Once this User Story is well-defined, break down the 'Technical Brainstorm' items into separate `‚öôÔ∏è Technical Task` sub issues.**
